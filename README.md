Project description: Local library:
Your neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. 
One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

Other people are taking care of the logistics and design, but they need you to build the algorithms.

This project is designed to test your ability to work with large datasets and build algorithms based on those datasets. 
You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project. Before taking on this project, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:

Differentiating between the three most common JavaScript error types

Solving bugs by using error messages

Differentiating between let, const, and var, and using each appropriately

Creating an array from a string based on particular criteria and joining arrays into strings

Writing strings that embed expressions using template literals

Accessing all the values and keys of an object

Using find(), filter(), map(), some(), and every() to solve different problems

Using reduce() to solve different problems

Using sort() to sort arrays in various ways
